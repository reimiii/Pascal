## Pascal

Pascal is a general-purpose, imperative and procedural programming language, designed in 1968 and published in 1970 by Niklaus Wirth as a small, efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring. It is named in honor of the French mathematician, philosopher and physicist Blaise Pascal.

Pascal was designed to be compiled from a relatively high-level language to machine code. It was also designed to be portable, and to be implemented on a wide variety of computer architectures and operating systems. It has been used to create commercial software and to teach computer science and programming to beginners.

Pascal was originally developed by Niklaus Wirth at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich) in the late 1960s. It was designed to be compiled from a relatively high-level language to machine code. It was also designed to be portable, and to be implemented on a wide variety of computer architectures and operating systems. It has been used to create commercial software and to teach computer science and programming to beginners.
