## Pascal

Pascal is a statically typed, imperative, procedural, and object-oriented programming language. It was developed by Niklaus Wirth in 1970 and published in 1972. It was designed to be a small, efficient language suitable for use in embedded systems, with language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions. Pascal was also designed to encourage clear program structure, which makes it a good language for teaching structured programming.

Pascal is named in honor of the French mathematician, philosopher and physicist Blaise Pascal. Pascal was originally intended to be compiled from a source language into efficient object code for some specific computer architecture. The language was designed to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring. It provided constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and had a simple but efficient run-time system. Pascal was also designed to be portable, and could be implemented on a wide variety of computer architectures and operating systems.
